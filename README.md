This script is bundled within [mkmatter](https://github.com/IotaSpencer/mkmatter) to provide a consistent approach to editing with mkmatter.

Thanks to @zyedidia for allowing me to bundle micro.
And thanks to @benweissmann for making [the original installation script](https://github.com/benweissmann/getmic.ro) which this is ported from bash to ruby.
