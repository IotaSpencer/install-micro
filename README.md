This script is bundled within [mkmatter](https://github.com/IotaSpencer/mkmatter) to provide a consistent approach to editing with mkmatter.

Thanks to [@zyedidia](https://github.com/zyedidia) for allowing me to bundle micro.
And thanks to [@benweissmann](https://github.com/benweissmann) for making [the original installation script](https://github.com/benweissmann/getmic.ro) which this is ported from bash to ruby.
